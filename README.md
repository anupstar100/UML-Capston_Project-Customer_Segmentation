# **UML-Capston_Project-Customer_Segmentation**

## *Introduction*
Customer segmentation is the process of separating customers into groups on the basis of their shared behavior or other attributes. The groups should be homogeneous within themselves and should also be heterogeneous to each other. The overall aim of this process is to identify high-value customer base i.e. customers that have the highest growth potential or are the most profitable.

Insights from customer segmentation are used to develop tailor-made marketing campaigns and for designing overall marketing strategy and planning.

A key consideration for a company would be whether or not to segment its customers and how to do the process of segmentation. This would depend upon the company philosophy and the type of product or services it offers. The type of segmentation criterion followed would create a big difference in the way the business operates and formulates its strategy. This is elucidated below:
  1. Zero segment (Undifferentiated approach)
  2. One segment (Focused approach)
  3. Two or more segments (Differentiated approach)
  4. Thousands of segments (Hyper segmentation approach)

Once the company has identified its customer base and the number of segments it aims to focus upon, it needs to decide the factors on whose basis it will decide to segment its customers.
